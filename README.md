🖼️ CGGNet on CIFAR-10 🖥️

Overview 🌟
This project uses CGGNet, a deep learning model, to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to build a model that can predict the class of each image in the dataset.
The model is built upon the popular VGG16 architecture, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and fine-tuned to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning, where the model is first trained on a large, diverse dataset and later adapted to a smaller dataset.

-----------------------------
Dataset 📊
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains images of 10 classes:

Airplane,Automobile,Bird,Cat,Deer,Dog,Frog,Horse,Ship,Truck

Each image is 32x32 pixels, and the dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

-----------------------------------
Workflow 🔄

1. Data Preprocessing 🔧
We start by applying a series of transformations to prepare the data for training:
Resize: All images are resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input size expected by the VGG16 model.
ToTensor: Converts images to PyTorch tensors.
Normalize: Normalizes the images with a mean and standard deviation of 0.5 for each RGB channel.

2. Model Architecture 🏗️
We use a modified VGG16 model, pretrained on ImageNet, and adjust the final layer to fit the 10 output classes of CIFAR-10
3. Training the Model 🏋️
The model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We run the training loop for a specified number of epochs and calculate the loss using CrossEntropyLoss.
4. Testing and Accuracy Evaluation 🎯
After training, we evaluate the model on the test set, calculating its accuracy and generating a classification report.
. Final Results 📈
The model's performance is measured based on its accuracy on the test dataset. We aim to achieve high accuracy, but we can experiment with additional fine-tuning or hyperparameter adjustments to improve results.
---------------------------
Future Improvements 🚀
Fine-tune the model further by adjusting the learning rate, epochs, or using a different optimizer.
Use data augmentation to make the model more robust.
Try more advanced architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
